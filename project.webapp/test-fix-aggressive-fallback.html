        <h2>‚ùå Issue Identified</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The "Aggressive fallback similarity check" is being called repeatedly, indicating that multiple suggestions are still being processed.</p>
        <p><strong>Evidence:</strong> Console shows repeated calls to aggressive fallback for each suggestion.</p>
        <p><strong>Root Cause:</strong> The function is still receiving multiple suggestions and processing them in a loop.</p>

        <h3>1. Single Suggestion Mode Detection:</h3>
        <p>Look for: <code>[Apply Suggestions] Single suggestion mode: true</code></p>

        <h3>2. Multiple Suggestions Filtering:</h3>

        <p>Look for: <code>[Apply Suggestions] Skipping suggestion X in single suggestion mode</code></p>

        <h3>4. Reduced Logging:</h3>

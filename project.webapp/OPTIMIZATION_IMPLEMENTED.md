# ✅ Page-Specific Optimization - IMPLEMENTED!

## What Was Changed

### **Backend File Modified:**
`backend/aiVisibilityService.js` - `getVisibilityData()` function

### **Optimization Logic Added:**

Now the backend runs different analysis based on which page is requesting:

```javascript
if (pageType === 'dashboard') {
  // Lightweight: Only Gemini, 1 prompt
  // Skips: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity
}
else if (pageType === 'productInsight') {
  // Medium: Only Gemini, 2 prompts
  // Skips: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity
}
else {
  // Competitor Insight: Gemini + ChatGPT (focused)
  // Skips: Claude, Perplexity (unreliable, redundant)
}
```

## API Call Reduction

### **Dashboard:**
- **Before**: 14 prompts × 8 competitors × 4 AIs = 112 API calls
- **After**: 1 prompt × 8 competitors × 1 AI = **8 API calls**
- **Savings**: 93% reduction! ⚡

### **Product Insight:**
- **Before**: 14 prompts × 8 competitors × 4 AIs = 112 API calls
- **After**: 2 prompts × 8 competitors × 1 AI = **16 API calls**
- **Savings**: 86% reduction! ⚡

### **Competitor Insight:**
- **Before**: 14 prompts × 8 competitors × 4 AIs = 112 API calls
- **After**: 3 prompts × 8 competitors × 2 AIs = **24 API calls**
- **Savings**: 79% reduction! ⚡

## Rollback Plan

If something breaks, revert by changing this line in `backend/aiVisibilityService.js`:

**Find line ~6916:**
```javascript
if (pageType === 'dashboard') {
```

**Change to:**
```javascript
if (false && pageType === 'dashboard') {
```

This will disable the optimization and go back to full analysis for all pages.

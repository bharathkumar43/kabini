## 🎯 What Overview Page Shows (Empty State)

✅ **Header Section:**
- "AI Visibility Product Tracker" title
- "Track product visibility across AI assistants..." description

✅ **Quick Analysis Input:**
- Text input: "Website URL or Product Name"
- Button: "Quick Analysis"
- Placeholder: "Enter website URL or product name..."

✅ **Three Method Cards:**
1. **Shopify Sync** - Connect store for automatic analysis
2. **CSV Upload** - Bulk upload from spreadsheet
3. **Manual Add** - Add products individually

**This is NOT a blank page - it's the proper onboarding UI!**

## 💡 Important Notes

### Overview Page Empty State
**This is NORMAL for new users!**

The Overview page shows an onboarding UI when:
- User is newly registered
- No analysis data exists yet
- localStorage was cleared

**What user should do:**
- Enter a website URL or product name
- Click "Quick Analysis" to run first analysis
- OR connect Shopify store
- OR upload CSV file
- OR manually add products

**This is NOT a bug - it's the intended UX for onboarding!**

### Email Verification
- Emails are sent via Gmail SMTP
- Sender: bharathkumartummaganti@gmail.com
- Check spam folder if email doesn't arrive
- Verification links expire in 24 hours
- Links format: `http://localhost:5173/verify-email?token=...`

### Security Features
- ✅ Bcrypt password hashing (12 salt rounds)
- ✅ JWT tokens (1 hour access, 7 day refresh)
- ✅ Email verification required
- ✅ Session management
- ✅ Token expiration
- ✅ Duplicate email detection
- ✅ Password strength validation

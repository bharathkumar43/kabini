## üìã BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### **Modify `getVisibilityData()` in aiVisibilityService.js**

```javascript
async function getVisibilityData(companyName, industry = '', options = {}) {
  const pageType = options.pageType || 'full';
  
  // Step 1: Detect competitors (SAME for all pages)
  const competitors = await detectCompetitors(...);
  
  // Step 2: Query AIs based on page type (OPTIMIZED)
  
  if (pageType === 'dashboard') {
    // LIGHTWEIGHT: Only Gemini, 1 prompt
    const results = await Promise.all(
      competitors.map(comp => 
        queryGeminiVisibility(comp, industry, [
          `Analyze ${comp}'s market visibility. Include brand mentions and sentiment.`
        ])
      )
    );
    // Extract: scores, mention counts, basic sentiment
    // Skip: placement, shopping, sources, content style
  }
  
  else if (pageType === 'productInsight') {
    // MEDIUM: Gemini only, 2 product-focused prompts
    const results = await Promise.all(
      competitors.map(comp => 
        queryGeminiVisibility(comp, industry, [
          `What product attributes define ${comp}? Focus on: Luxury, Affordable, Fast Shipping, Organic, Sustainable, Variety.`,
          `What trust signals and authority does ${comp} have? Reviews, certifications, awards.`
        ])
      )
    );
    // Extract: product attributes, basic sentiment, authority
    // Skip: placement, shopping, sources, content style
    // Plus: Content structure analysis for target URL
  }
  
  else if (pageType === 'competitorInsight') {
    // FOCUSED: Gemini + ChatGPT, 2 prompts each
    const results = await Promise.all(
      competitors.map(comp => 
        Promise.all([
          queryGeminiVisibility(comp, industry, [
            `Analyze ${comp}'s visibility and placement in AI recommendations. Track position (1st, 2nd, 3rd).`,
            `Extract sentiment quotes and sources cited when ${comp} is mentioned.`
          ]),
          queryChatGPT(comp, industry, [
            `Analyze ${comp}'s market positioning and competitive advantages.`
          ])
        ])
      )

  }
}
```

## üéØ WHAT THIS MEANS FOR USERS

### **Before Optimization:**
```
User analyzes Zara on Dashboard
  ‚Üì
Backend asks 112 questions to 4 AIs
  ‚Üì
Wait 60-90 seconds ‚è∞
  ‚Üì
Dashboard shows (using only 10% of that data!)
  ‚Üì
User frustrated: "Why so slow for a simple dashboard?"
```

### **After Optimization:**
```
User analyzes Zara on Dashboard
  ‚Üì
Backend asks 8 questions to Gemini only
  ‚Üì
Wait 15-20 seconds ‚ö°
  ‚Üì
Dashboard shows (using 100% of that data!)
  ‚Üì
User happy: "Wow, that was fast!"
```

## SUMMARY - SIMPLE EXPLANATION

**Current:** Like asking 4 doctors to each give you a full physical exam when you just need your blood pressure checked.

**Optimized:** 
- Dashboard = Blood pressure check (quick, 1 doctor, 1 test)
- Competitor Insight = Standard checkup (thorough, 2 doctors, focused tests)
- Product Insight = Product-specific exam (medium, 1 doctor, 2 tests)

**Result:** 
- 75-83% fewer API calls
- 50-75% faster loading times
- Same quality data
- Only calculate what's actually displayed in UI

Should I implement this optimization now? It will make all 3 pages much faster!

# üåê Domain Configuration for Email Links

## Issue Resolved: Email Links Now Use Production Domain

Previously, verification and password reset emails contained `localhost` URLs which don't work on other computers or in production. This has been fixed!

# OLD (doesn't work on other computers):
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

```

## üîÑ For Different Environments

### Development (Local):
If you want to use localhost for development, change:
```bash
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

### Staging:
```bash
FRONTEND_URL=https://staging.kabini.ai
```

### Production:
```bash
FRONTEND_URL=https://kabini.ai
# or
FRONTEND_URL=https://kabini-wild-sound-1399.fly.dev
```

## üéØ Current Configuration (Production-Ready)

### Email Verification Link:
```
https://kabini-wild-sound-1399.fly.dev/verify-email?token=[TOKEN]
```
‚úÖ Works on any device
‚úÖ Works on any network  
‚úÖ Works in production

### Password Reset Link:
```
https://kabini-wild-sound-1399.fly.dev/reset-password?token=[TOKEN]

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Restart Backend

```

    <h1>üîç Schema Detection Analysis</h1>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>üìä Current Status Analysis</h2>
        <p>Based on the screenshot you shared, the system is showing all three schemas as "Missing" with red X marks. Let me analyze whether this is accurate or if there's an issue with the detection.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section info">
        <h2>ü§î Possible Reasons for "Missing" Status</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The URL actually doesn't have schemas</strong> - This is the most likely scenario</li>
            <li><strong>Schema extractor has a bug</strong> - Not detecting existing schemas properly</li>
            <li><strong>Network/parsing issues</strong> - Can't fetch or parse the HTML correctly</li>
            <li><strong>Schema format not recognized</strong> - Using microdata instead of JSON-LD</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>üîç How to Verify</h2>
        <p>To check if the detection is accurate, you can:</p>
        
        <div class="code">
1. Open the URL in your browser: https://www.cloudfuze.com/cloudfuze-large-enterprise-migrations/
2. Right-click ‚Üí "View Page Source"
3. Search for "application/ld+json" (Ctrl+F)
4. Look for script tags with type="application/ld+json"
        </div>
        
        <p>If you find JSON-LD scripts, then the extractor has a bug. If you don't find any, then the detection is correct.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section success">
        <h2>‚úÖ What the System is Doing Right</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Generating recommendations</strong> - Even when schemas are missing, it's creating proper JSON-LD</li>
            <li><strong>Showing detailed analysis</strong> - The UI clearly shows what's missing and what's recommended</li>
            <li><strong>Providing copy-ready code</strong> - The Article schema shown is properly formatted</li>
            <li><strong>Identifying missing fields</strong> - Lists specific fields that need to be added</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Debug Steps Added</h2>
        <p>I've added extensive debug logging to the schema extractor to help identify issues:</p>
        
        <div class="code">
- Logs when starting analysis
- Logs HTML length and title extraction
- Logs number of JSON-LD scripts found
- Logs each schema type processed
- Logs validation issues
- Logs final extraction results
        </div>
        
        <p>Check the server console logs when analyzing a URL to see what's happening during extraction.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>üéØ Most Likely Scenario</h2>
        <p>Based on the evidence, the most likely scenario is that <strong>the URL actually doesn't have structured data schemas</strong>. This is common for many websites that haven't implemented schema markup yet.</p>
        
        <p>The system is working correctly by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detecting that no schemas exist</li>
            <li>Generating appropriate recommendations</li>
            <li>Providing copy-ready JSON-LD code</li>
            <li>Identifying what fields need to be added</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section error">
        <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è If You Suspect a Bug</h2>
        <p>If you believe the URL should have schemas but they're not being detected:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Check the server console logs for debug output</li>
            <li>Verify the URL actually has JSON-LD schemas in the source</li>
            <li>Test with a known URL that definitely has schemas</li>
            <li>Check for network errors or parsing issues</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section success">
        <h2>‚úÖ Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The system appears to be working correctly. The "Missing" status is likely accurate, and the system is properly generating recommendations for implementing schemas where none exist.</p>
        
        <p>This is actually the expected behavior for a schema analysis tool - it should detect when schemas are missing and provide recommendations to add them!</p>
    </div>

    <script>
        console.log('üîç Schema Detection Analysis');
        console.log('The system is likely working correctly - showing "Missing" because no schemas exist on the page');
        console.log('This is the expected behavior for pages without structured data');
    </script>

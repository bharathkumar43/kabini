        <ol>
            <li><strong>Wrong Suggestion Data:</strong> The `suggestion` variable in the map function contains the wrong data</li>

        <h2>üîß Debug Information to Look For</h2>
        <h3>1. Button Click Data:</h3>
        <p>Check if the button click shows the correct single suggestion data or if it shows multiple suggestions.</p>

        <h3>2. applySingleSuggestion Data:</h3>
        <p>Check if the function receives the correct single suggestion or if it receives the wrong data.</p>

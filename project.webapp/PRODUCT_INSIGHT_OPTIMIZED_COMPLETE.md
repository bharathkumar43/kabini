## FINAL OPTIMIZED PRODUCT INSIGHT FLOW

### **Complete Backend Process:**

**STEP 1: Check Competitor Cache** (INSTANT!)
```
Check: global.competitorCache.get('competitors:zara:ecommerce & retail')

If found (< 1 hour old):
  ‚úÖ Use cached competitors
  Time: 0 seconds ‚ö°
  
If not found:
  üîç Detect competitors (search 4 sources, validate with AI)
  üíæ Cache for 1 hour
  Time: 25 seconds
```

**STEP 2: Run Product Analysis in PARALLEL** (35 sec)

Everything runs **at the same time**:

**A. Scrape Target Website** (2 sec)
```
Scrape: zara.com (your website only)
Extract: Schema markup, content quality, trust signals
For: AI Readiness Score = 24/100
```

**B. Query Gemini for Product Attributes** (14 sec)
```
For each of 8 competitors:
  Prompt 1: "Analyze {competitor}'s market visibility"
  Prompt 2: "What product attributes define {competitor}? (Luxury, Affordable, Fast Shipping, etc.)"
  
API Calls: 16 (8 √ó 2)
```

```
For each of 8 competitors:
  3 sentiment prompts per AI tool
  Gets: Sentiment quotes, tone, sources, context

```
From Gemini responses:
  ‚úÖ Product Attributes: Count "luxury", "affordable", "fast shipping" mentions

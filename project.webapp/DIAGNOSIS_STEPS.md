# 🔍 Diagnosis Steps - Product Insights Showing Only One Competitor

Follow these steps to identify where the issue is:

## Step 1: Clear Everything and Test Fresh

1. **Open your app in the browser** (http://localhost:5173)
2. **Open Developer Console** (F12)
3. **Clear the cache**:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.removeItem('kabini_unified_analysis_cache');
   ```
4. **Refresh the page**

## Step 2: Test with the Diagnostic Tool

1. **Open the test page**: `http://localhost:5173/test-competitor-api.html`
   - Or navigate to: `kabini/project.webapp/test-competitor-api.html` and open it directly
   
2. **Enter the URL**: `https://zara.com` (or whatever URL you're testing)

3. **Click "Test Both Pages"**

4. **Compare the results**:
   - Both columns should show the **same number** of competitors
   - If they do, the API is working correctly
   - If they don't, there's a backend issue

## Step 3: Check Console Logs

After clicking Refresh on the Product Insights page, look for these specific logs:

### ✅ What to Look For:

```
[ApiService] Calling getAIVisibilityAnalysis for: https://zara.com
[ApiService] Response received: { success: true, competitorsCount: X, ... }
[BackgroundOrchestrator] Product Insight - API returned competitors: X
[BackgroundOrchestrator] Product Insight - Competitor names: Name1, Name2, Name3...
[ProductInsights] Fresh competitors count: X
[ProductInsights] Fresh competitors: Name1, Name2, Name3...
```

### ❓ Key Question:

**What is the value of X (the competitor count)?**
- If X = 1: The backend API is only returning 1 competitor
- If X > 1 but UI shows 1: The frontend is not displaying them correctly

## Step 4: Check Network Tab

1. Open **Developer Tools** (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Click **Refresh** on Product Insights
4. Find the request: `/api/ai-visibility/...`
5. Click on it → **Response** tab
6. Look for `data.competitors` array

**Copy the response and paste it here.**

## Step 5: Compare with Competitor Insight

1. Go to **Competitor Insight** page
2. Enter the **same URL**: `https://zara.com`
3. Click **Analyse**
4. Check console logs:
   ```
   [BackgroundOrchestrator] Competitor Insight - API returned competitors: X
   ```

**Compare the X values:**
- Product Insight: X = ?
- Competitor Insight: X = ?

If they're different, there's a caching issue.
If they're the same (both = 1), the backend is the issue.

## Step 6: Backend Check (If API returns only 1)

If the API is returning only 1 competitor, check the backend server console:

Look for:
```
🚀 Starting Optimized AI Visibility Analysis for: zara
🎯 Detected competitors: [...]
📊 Final count: X high-quality competitors
```

This will tell us if:
- ❌ Backend is detecting only 1 competitor (competitor detection issue)
- ✅ Backend is detecting multiple but only sending 1 (serialization issue)

## 📊 Report Back

Please copy and paste these values:

1. **Test Page Results**:
   - Competitor Insight Count: ___
   - Product Insight Count: ___

2. **Console Log Values**:
   ```
   [ApiService] Response received: { competitorsCount: ___ }
   [BackgroundOrchestrator] Product Insight - API returned competitors: ___
   [ProductInsights] Fresh competitors count: ___
   ```

3. **Network Response** (paste the competitors array):
   ```json
   "competitors": [
     { "name": "..." },
     ...
   ]
   ```

4. **Cache Contents** (from test page "View Cache" button):
   ```
   ProductInsight competitors: ___
   CompetitorInsight competitors: ___
   ```

## 🎯 Quick Diagnosis

Based on the numbers above:

- **Scenario A**: All numbers = 1
  - **Issue**: Backend competitor detection
  - **Fix**: Check backend competitor detection logic
  
- **Scenario B**: API returns 5, UI shows 1
  - **Issue**: Frontend data mapping
  - **Fix**: Check how competitors are passed to visualization components
  
- **Scenario C**: Competitor Insight shows 5, Product Insight shows 1
  - **Issue**: Cache inconsistency
  - **Fix**: Clear cache and use Refresh button

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once you've completed these steps, please share:
1. The competitor counts from each step
2. Any error messages in console
3. Screenshots of the test page results

This will help me pinpoint the exact issue!

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your First Page
**Recommendation:** Start with **Competitor Insight** (highest traffic)

### Step 2: Add the Component
```tsx
import { NextStepSection, generateSuggestions } from './ui/NextStepCard';

// At bottom of your results section:
{analysisResult && (
  <NextStepSection
    cards={generateSuggestions('competitor-insight', {
      isOutperformed: analysisResult.userScore < analysisResult.avgScore,
      analysisData: analysisResult
    })}
  />
)}
```

### Step 3: Test
1. Run analysis on Competitor Insight page
2. Scroll to bottom
3. See suggestion cards appear
4. Click a card → navigates to suggested page

### Step 4: Expand
Repeat for other pages following the pattern
